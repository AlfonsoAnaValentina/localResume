      "description": "Starting in Spark Digital it was a new challenge that it was interesting to face,
      getting used to a different team, and a different working environment, to
      deliver a solution that may differ or not to other companies, to the Kaplan
      Universitiy, using a cms for the very first time, improving the soft skills also.
      So far I've been working in four projects, three were for Macmillan, and
      currently I'm working with react from an year ago. Constantly learning and
      adapting ares kills that I like to constantly improve."

      and it was, I worked in the CNN project, and as a first approachment I meet the client and interact with them,
      so it was really a good experienced to know a project from scratch, on the technology side,
      I've learned how to work with lodash, less, nodejs, grunt  in unit testing with mocha and karma (ugh),
      and also made a month introduction to aws (amazon web service)."

      and having it as a first job,  in this case I developed an insurance web app, with backbone, jquery, jasmine
      (not so much about this for me :P), express, require, underscore, bootstrap. The version control was github,
      a whole new experience to me considering that the only version control manager known to me before this it was cvs version control."
